# Smart E-Commerce Implementation Plan

The objective is to build a production-ready Smart E-Commerce web application using the MERN stack with advanced features like Stripe integration, recommendation logic, dynamic PDF invoices, and a functional admin dashboard.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review this implementation plan. Specifically, confirm if:
> 1. Using **Vite** with React (and Tailwind CSS for rapid modern UI) is acceptable for the frontend.
> 2. The proposed database schema and folder structure meet your expectations.

## Proposed Architecture & Tech Stack

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **Node.js & Express.js:** API server with robust error handling and proper MVC architecture.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** Data storage and ODM.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless auth with role-based access control (User/Admin).
- **Payments:** Stripe integration for test payments.
- **PDF Generation:** PDFKit to generate accurate order invoices.
- **Analytics:** MongoDB Aggregation pipelines for fast sales chart generation.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React (via Vite):** Fast, modern frontend architecture.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM v6.
- **HTTP Client:** Axios with interceptors for attaching JWT tokens automatically.
- **State Management:** React Context API (or Zustand) to manage Cart and Auth state.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or pure CSS as requested per web_application_development instructions, though Tailwind is industry standard for React apps; we will use beautiful vanilla CSS or standard utility frameworks pending confirmation). *Note: The system instructions recommend vanilla CSS for maximum control unless Tailwind is requested. We will stick to a heavily curated Vanilla CSS approach or modern CSS Modules to ensure rich aesthetics without Tailwind unless user approves.*
- **Charts:** Chart.js + react-chartjs-2 for the admin dashboard.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Postman / ThunderClient collections will be written/used to test backend APIs (Auth, Products, Cart, Analytics) before integrating with the frontend.
- Backend routing and endpoints will be validated using explicit cURL or Node scripts simulating edge-cases.

### Manual Verification
- We will manually navigate the frontend to verify:
  1. Successful login and JWT retention.
  2. Smooth cart updates.
  3. Proper checkout flow catching the Stripe test payment lifecycle.
  4. PDF download triggering flawlessly.
  5. Admin views successfully restricting non-admin users and displaying data.
